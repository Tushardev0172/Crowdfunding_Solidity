# Crowdfunding Project

Welcome to our Solidity crowdfunding project! We're excited to have you here and appreciate your interest in supporting our initiative. This README will provide you with all the necessary information to understand our project and contribute to its success.


## Getting Started
To get started with the crowdfunding project, follow these instructions:
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/crowdfunding-solidity.git
- Navigate to the project directory: cd crowdFunding-solidity
* Install dependencies: npm install
## Smart Contract
The main smart contract file is Crowdfunding.sol and it contains the implementation of the crowdFunding campaign. It includes the following features:

- Create a new crowdfunding campaign.
- Contribute to an existing campaign.
- Track the total amount raised for each campaign.
- Allow the campaign creator to withdraw funds after the campaign is completed.
- Refund contributors if the campaign fails to reach its goal within the specified duration.
## Testing
The test directory contains unit tests for the smart contract. To run the tests, use the following command:

- truffle test

Make sure you have Truffle installed globally: npm install -g truffle.

## Deployment
To deploy the crowdfunding smart contract to a blockchain network, follow these steps:
- Configure the deployment parameters in truffle-config.js.
- Run the deployment command: truffle migrate --network <network-name>
- Replace <network-name> with the desired network (e.g., development, ropsten, mainnet).
